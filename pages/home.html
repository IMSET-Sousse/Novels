        <p>You know… when I just came here, I was ready to die. After all, in this whole world — two worlds, actually — there's not a single soul who cares whether I live or die. When I'm gone, no one will be sad. No one will even remember that I existed. But then I changed my mind. Somewhere along the way, I decided to survive. I must survive, no matter what...To spite you all.</p>
